            This JavaScript code targets all anchor elements with an href
            attribute starting with # and adds a click event listener. When such
            a link is clicked, it prevents the default behavior, finds the
            target element with the corresponding ID, and smoothly scrolls to
            that element.
            <br />
            This jQuery code does the same thing as the JavaScript example. It
            selects all anchor elements with an href attribute starting with #
            and adds a click event listener. When clicked, it smoothly scrolls
            to the target element using the animate function.
            <br />
            Choose the approach that best fits your project. If you only need
            smooth scrolling, the CSS scroll-behavior property is a simple and
            effective solution. If you need more control or additional
            functionality, you might prefer using JavaScript or jQuery.

            The Impact of Technology on Modern Society In the dynamic landscape
            of the 21st century, technology stands as the driving force behind
            unprecedented changes in society. From the way we communicate to the
            manner in which we conduct business and access information,
            technology has woven itself into the fabric of our daily lives,
            shaping our behaviors and perceptions in profound ways.
            <br />
            One of the most noticeable impacts of technology is evident in the
            realm of communication. The advent of the internet, social media
            platforms, and instant messaging services has revolutionized the way
            we connect with one another. Geographical distances have become mere
            numbers as individuals can engage in real-time conversations,
            bridging gaps and fostering a sense of global community. However,
            this connectivity has its nuances, bringing about both enhanced
            communication and challenges such as information overload and
            privacy concerns.
            <br />
            Moreover, technology has reshaped the workplace, introducing remote
            work capabilities and automating routine tasks. The rise of
            artificial intelligence and machine learning has led to the creation
            of smart systems that can analyze data, predict trends, and optimize
            processes. While this has undoubtedly increased efficiency, it also
            raises questions about the future of certain job sectors and the
            need for upskilling to adapt to this technological evolution.
            <br />
            In the field of healthcare, technology has played a pivotal role in
            improving diagnostics, treatment options, and patient care.
            Telemedicine has become a viable option for remote consultations,
            enhancing accessibility to healthcare services. Additionally,
            wearable devices and health apps empower individuals to monitor
            their well-being proactively, fostering a shift towards preventative
            healthcare.
            <br />
            However, the ubiquity of technology has its drawbacks, particularly
            in the context of privacy and data security. As we embrace smart
            devices and interconnected systems, concerns arise about the
            protection of personal information and the potential misuse of data.
            Striking a balance between technological innovation and safeguarding
            individual privacy remains a critical challenge for society.
            <br />
            Education, too, has witnessed a transformative impact due to
            technology. E-learning platforms, interactive educational tools, and
            virtual classrooms have democratized access to knowledge. The
            ability to learn anytime, anywhere has become a reality, breaking
            down traditional barriers to education. Yet, the digital divide
            persists, with disparities in access to technology hindering the
            educational opportunities of certain demographics.
            <br />
            In conclusion, the impact of technology on modern society is
            multifaceted, influencing the way we communicate, work, access
            healthcare, and educate ourselves. While technology has undoubtedly
            brought about numerous benefits, it also poses challenges that
            demand thoughtful consideration and ethical decision-making. As we
            navigate this ever-evolving technological landscape, it is essential
            to harness its potential for positive transformation while
            addressing its societal implications with a vigilant and responsible
            approach.
